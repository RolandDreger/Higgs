The lower surface continues irregularly plane, while the upper rises into conical or hemispherical heaps; which may afterwards continue long nearly of the same bulk, or rapidly grow to the size of moimtains.</p><p>In the former case they are usually numerous and near together, in the latter few and distant; but whether there are few or many, their <em>bases</em> lie always nearly in one horizontal plane; and their increase upward is somewhat proportionate to the extent of base, and nearly alike in many that appear at once.</p><p>Their appearance, increase, and disappearance, in <em>fair</em> weather, are often periodical, and keep pace with the Temperature of the day. Thus, they will begin to form some hours after sun-rise, arrive at their maximum in the hottest part of the afternoon, then go on diminishing, and totally disperse about sun-set.</p>"

Previous to <em>rain</em> it increases more rapidly, appears lower in the atmosphere, and with its surface full of loose fleeces or protuberances. </p><p>The formation of large Cumuli to leeward in a strong wind, indicates the approach of a calm with rain. When they do not disappear or subside about sun-set, but continue to rise, Thunder is to be expected in the night. </p><p>Independently of the beauty and magnificence it adds to the face of nature,* the Cumulus serves to screen the earth from the direct rays of the sun ; by its multiplied reflections to diffuse, and, as it were, economise the Light, and also to convey the product of Evaporation to a distance from the place of its origin. The relations of the Cumulus with the state of the Barometer, &amp;c., have not yet been enough attended to.</p>"
