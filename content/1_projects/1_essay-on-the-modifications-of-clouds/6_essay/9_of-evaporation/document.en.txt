It is on the nature of this process, the state in which the Vapour subsists for a time, and the means by which the Water becomes again visible, that the greatest diversity of opinion has prevailed. </p><p>The Chemical philosopher, seduced by analogy, and accustomed more to the action of liquids on solids, naturally regards Evaporation as a solution of water in the atmosphere, and the appearance of cloud as the first sign of its precipitation; which becoming afterwards (under favourable circumstances) more abundant, produces rain. The theory of Dr. Hutton goes a step further, assumes a certain rate of solution differing from that of the advance of temperature by which it is effected, and deduces a general explanation of clouds and rain from the precipitation which, according to his rule, should result from every mixture of different portions of saturated air. The fundamental principle of this theory has been disproved in an essay heretofore presented to the Society,* and which was written under the opinion, at present generally adopted by chemists, that evaporation depends on a solvent power in the atmosphere, and follows the general rules of chemical solution. </p>"

            "text": "<p>The author has since espoused a theory of evaporation which altogether excludes the above-named opinion, (and consequently Dr. Hutton's also,) and considers himself in a great degree indebted to it for the origin of the explanation he is about to offer. It will be proper, therefore, to state the fundamental propositions of this theory, with such other parts as appear immediately necessary, referring for mathematical demonstrations and detail of experiments to the work itself, which is entitled “Experimental Essays on the Constitution of mixed Gases; on the Force of Steam or Vapour from Water and other Liquids in different Temperatures, both in a Torricellian Vacuum and in Air; on Evaporation; and on the Expansion of Elastic Fluids by Heat. By John Dalton” — See Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, vol. v. part 2. — The propositions are as follows: </p><p>“1. When two elastic fluids, denoted by <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, are mixed together, there is no mutual repulsion amongst their particles; that is, the particles of <em>A</em> do not repel those of <em>B</em>, as they do one another.” Consequently, the pressure or whole weight upon any one particle arises solely from those of its own kind. </p><p>“2. The force of steam from all liquids is the same at equal distances above or below the several temperatures at which they boil in the open air: and that force is the same under any pressure of another elastic fluid as it is in vacuo. Thus tlie force of aqueous vapour of 212° is equal to 30 inches of mercury; at 30° below, or 182°, it is of half that force; and at 40° above, or 252°, it is of double the force. So likewise the vapour from Sulphuric ether, which boils at 102°, then supporting 30 inches of mercury, at 30° below that temperature has half the force, and at 40° above it double the force : and so in other liquids. Moreover, the force of aqueous vapour of 60° is nearly equal to half an inch of mercury when admitted into a Torricellian vacuum: and water of the same temperature, confined with perfectly dry air, increases the elasticity to just the same amount. </p><p>“3. The quantity of any liquid evaporated in the open air is directly as the force of steam from such liquid at its temperature, all other circumstances being the same.” </p><p>The following is part of the Essay on Evaporation. </p><p>“When a liquid is exposed to the air, it becomes gradually dissipated in it: the process by which this effect is produced we call <em>Evaporation</em>. </p><p>“Many Philosophers concur in the theory of chemical solution. Atmospheric air, it is said, has an affinity for water; it is a menstruum in which water is soluble to a certain degree. It is allowed notwithstanding by all, that each liquid is convertible into an elastic vapour in <em>vacuo</em>, which can subsist independently in any temperature. But as the utmost forces of these vapours are inferior to the pressure of the atmosphere in ordinary temperatures, they are supposed to be incapable of existing in it in the same way as they do in a Torricellian vacuum: hence the notion of affinity is induced. According to this theory of Evaporation, atmospheric air (and every other species of air for aught that appears) dissolves water, alcohol, ether, acids, and even metals. Water below 212° is chemically combined with the gases. Above 212° it assumes a new form, and becomes a distinct elastic fluid, called <em>steam.</em> Whether water first chemically combined with air, and then heated above 212°, is detached from the air or remains with it, the advocates of the theory have not determined. This theory has always been considered as complex, and attended with difficulties; so much so, that M. Pictet and others have rejected it, and adopted that which admits of distinct elastic vapours in the atmosphere at all temperatures, uncombined with either of the principal constituent gases ; as being much more simple and easy of explication than the other: though they do not remove the grand objection to it, arising from atmospheric pressure.” </p><p>“<em>On the Evaporation of Water below</em> 212°. </p><p>“I have frequently tried the Evaporation at all the temperatures below 212°. It would be tedious to enter into a detail of all the experiments, but I shall give the results at some remarkable points. </p><p>“The evaporation from water of 180° was from 18 to 22 grains per minute, according to circumstances : or about one-half of that at 212°. </p><p>“At 164° it was about one-third of the quantity at the boiling temperature, or from 10 to 16 grains per minute. </p><p>“At 152° it was only one-fourth of that at boiling, or from 8 to 12 grains, according to circumstances. </p><p>“The temperature of 144° affords one-fifth of the efiect at boiling; 138° gave one-sixth, &amp;c. </p><p>“Having previously to these experiments determined the force of aqueous vapour at all the temperatures under 212°, I was naturally led to examine whether the quantity of water evaporated in a given time bore any proportion to the force of vapour of the same temperature, and was agreeably surprised to find that they exactly corresponded in every part of the thermometric scale : thus the forces of vapour at 212°, 180°, 164°, 152°, 144°, and 138°, are equal to 30, 15, 10, 7 1/2, 6, and 5 inches of mercury respectively: and the grains of water evaporated per minute in those temperatures were 30, 15, 10, 7 1/2, 6, and 5, also; or numbers proportional to these. Indeed it should be so, from the established law of mechanics that all efiects are proportional to the causes producing them. The atmosphere, it should seem, obstructs the diffusion of vapour, which would otherwise be almost instantaneous, as in <em>vacuo</em>; but this obstruction is overcome in proportion to the force of the vapour. The obstruction, however, cannot arise from the weight of the atmosphere, as has till now been supposed; for then it would effectually prevent any vapour from rising under 212°; but it is caused by the vis <em>inertiæ</em> of the particles of air, and is similar to that which a stream of water meets with in descending amongst pebbles. </p><p>“The theory of evaporation being thus manifested from experiments in high temperatures, I found that if it was to be verified by experiments in low temperatures, regard must be had to the force of vapour actually existing in the atmosphere at the time. For instance, if water of 59° were the subject, the force of vapour of that temperature is 1-60th of the force at 212°, and one might expect the quantity of evaporation 1-60th also. But if it should happen, as it sometimes does in summer, that an aqueous atmosphere to that amount does already exist, the evaporation, instead of being 1-60th of that from boUing water, would be nothing at all. On the other hand, if the aqueous atmosphere were less than that, suppose one half of it, corresponding to 39° of heat, then the effective evaporating force would be 1-120th of that from boiling water. In short, the evaporating force must be universally equal to that of the temperature of the water, diminished by that already existing in the atmosphere. </p><p>In order to find the force of the aqueous atmosphere I usually take a tall cylindrical glass jar, dry on the outside, and fill it with cold spring water fresh from the well. If dew be immediately formed on the outside, I pour the water out, let it stand awhile to increase in heat, dry the outside of the glass well with a linen cloth, and then pour the water in again. This operation is to be continued till dew ceases to be formed, and then the temperature of the water must be observed ; and opposite to it in the table will be found the force of vapour in the atmosphere. This must be done in the open air, or at a window; because the air within is generally more humid than that without. Spring water is generally about 50°, and will mostly answer the purpose the three hottest months in the year; in other seasons an artificial cold mixture is required. The accuracy of the result obtained this way, I think, scarcely needs to be insisted on. Glass, and all other hard, smooth substances I have tried, when cooled to a degree below what the surrounding aqueous vapour can support, cause it to be condensed on their surfaces into water. The degree of cold is usually from 1° to 10° below the mean heat of the twenty-four hours ; in summer I have often observed the point as high as 58° or 59°, corresponding to half an inch of mercury in force ; and once or twice have seen it at 62°. In changeable and windy weather it is liable to a considerable fluctuation; but this is not the place to enlarge upon it. </p><p>“For the purpose of observing the Evaporation in atmospheric temperatures, I got two light tin vessels, the one six inches in diameter and half an inch deep, the other eight inches diameter and three-fourths of an inch deep, and made to be suspended from a balance. When any experiment, designed as a test of the theory, was made, a quantity of water was put into one of these, (generally the six-inch one, which I preferred,) the whole was weighed to a grain; then it was placed in an open window or other exposed situation for ten or fifteen minutes, and again weighed to ascertain the loss by evaporation : at the same time the temperature of the water was observed, the force of the aqueous atmosphere ascertained as above, and the strength of the current of air noticed. From a great variety of experiments made both in the winter and summer, and when the evaporating force was strong and weak, I have found the results entirely conformable with the above theory. The same quantity is evaporated with the same evaporating force thus determined, whatever be the temperature of the air, as near as can be judged; but with the same evaporating force, a strong wind will double the effect produced in a still atmosphere. Thus, if the aqueous atmosphere be correspondent to 40° of temperature and the air be 60°, the evaporation is the same as if the aqueous atmosphere were at 60° of temperature and the air 72°; and in a calm air the evaporation from a vessel of six inches in diameter, in such circumstances, would be about  ⋅9 of a grain per minute, and about 1⋅8 grains per minute in a very strong wind; the different intermediate quantities being regulated solely by the force of the wind.”</p>"
