This change takes place either throughout the whole mass at once, or progressively from one extremity to the other. In either case the same efiect is produced on a number of adjacent Cirri at the same time and in the same order. It appears in some instances to be accelerated by the approach of other Clouds. </p><p>This Modification forms a very beautiful sky, sometimes exhibiting numerous distinct beds of these small connected clouds, floating at different altitudes.</p>"
